## Abstract

This amendment increases the allocation of treasury resources that the DIMO Foundation can use to lend to market makers and onboard exchanges in order to improve the availability of the $DIMO token.

If passed, the DIMO Foundation will be authorized to loan an additional 15,000,000 $DIMO tokens to market makers (note that most frequently these loans are repaid by the market maker in cash or $DIMO within 12 months).&#x20;

The DIMO Foundation will also add an additional $1,000,000 in USD equivalent assets to its annual budget for the purposes of increasing the availability of $DIMO on new exchanges.

## Motivation

DIMO has demonstrated impressive growth and excellent technological progress. Combining this momentum with shifting market conditions, new DIMO-compatible hardware launching soon, expansion into new geographic regions, and the beginnings of the DIMO app and hardware ecosystem currently taking shape, there is an opportunity for the project to make bold and decisive moves to accelerate development and growth.

With the conclusion of the airdrop, roughly 26 million $DIMO went unclaimed. This proposal would redeploy these tokens for the purposes of diversifying and expanding the availability of the $DIMO token on new exchanges.  This helps ensure the availability of $DIMO for the ecosystem participants who need it, making DIMO more resilient and aiding in international expansion.

## Specification

_<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would edit the following section within the DIP-6 Specification section:</mark>_&#x20;

#### **Budget**

The DIMO Foundation anticipates spending approximately <mark style="color:red;">$1,800,000</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">$800,000</mark>~~ in 2023. $200,000 of that would be on administrative overhead, including directors salaries, legal fees, insurance, KYC services, technology subscriptions, and more. Another $600,000 would be to compensate contributors who build and grow the DIMO protocol. Digital Infrastructure Inc. is under contract to provide services at $150 per hour and is expected to be the largest such contributor. <mark style="color:red;">Up to $1,000,000 will be used to increase the availability of $DIMO on exchanges.</mark>

To leave some extra buffer for the unexpected, **this proposal gives the DIMO Foundation the authority to spend up to **<mark style="color:red;">**$2,000,000**</mark><mark style="color:red;">** **</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">**$1,000,000**</mark>~~** in USD equivalent in 2023 for relevant operations.**
