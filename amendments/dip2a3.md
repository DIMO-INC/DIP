## Abstract

This amendment reframes the points categories by integration type.

## Motivation

The new [DIMO LTE R1 by Ruptela](../license-proposals/dlp5.md), along with anticipated improvements to software connections, have exposed shortcomings in the current classifications around points for integration types. This proposal would reorient the language more clearly around data potential.&#x20;

It also increases the rewards for more limited OBD devices by 1,000 points, due to the Macaron having outperformed expectations on coverage and data throughput.

You might ask, "why do device connections continue earn more points than software connections?" This is because software connections cost more to maintain, require no upfront cost by the user, and, at least for now, require dependencies on third parties that could easily lead to disruptions. The OBD port, on the other hand, is protected by right to repair and privacy regulations and will remain accessible always.&#x20;

Nearly all cars that can connect via software can also add a hardware connection whereby rewards for both stack on top of each other, as shown in the example.

## Specification

<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would incorporate the following changes to the Specifications section of DIP-2:</mark>

In year one, DIMO will issue 1,105,000 $DIMO per week to all qualified DIMO users at 5 AM UTC each Monday. This issuance amount will automatically decrease by 15% every <mark style="color:red;">52 weeks following the anniversary of the December 12, 2024 mainnet launch</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">year</mark>~~, with Baseline Issuance ending in 40 years, unless modified by a future DIP.

...

Points <mark style="color:red;">for users</mark> are calculated as follows:

<mark style="color:red;">**Connection types**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: to be considered "Comprehensive", an integration must send extensive telemetry data in near real-time. As of the last update of this proposal, the AutoPi, LTE R1 and native Tesla connection qualify as comprehensive.</mark>

Users who fail to connect for three consecutive weeks will fall back one level.

In the example shown in the table above, Alice earns 2,000 points for having been connected between 2<mark style="color:red;">1</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">0</mark>~~ to 3<mark style="color:red;">5</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">6</mark>~~ weeks, 1,000 points for her Limited software connection, and 6,000 points for having <mark style="color:red;">comprehensive device</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">a Full-Size OBD Dongle</mark>~~ installed in her vehicle.

Here there are <mark style="color:red;">4</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">1</mark>~~0,000 cars connected to DIMO and each car generates an average of 6,000 points that week, for a total of <mark style="color:red;">24</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">6</mark>~~0,000,000 points. Alice's 9,000 points represent 0.0<mark style="color:red;">04</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">15</mark>~~% of the points for that week (9,000 √∑ <mark style="color:red;">24</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">6</mark>~~0,000,000). Therefore, she earns <mark style="color:red;">41.44</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">165.75</mark>~~ out of the 1,105,000 tokens from this pool (1,105,000 \* 0.0<mark style="color:red;">04</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">15</mark>~~%).

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-2 would be updated and these changes implemented once the software code is ready, or after the four day timelock, whichever is later.
