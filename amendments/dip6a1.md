## Abstract

This proposal would repurpose tokens set aside for market making to instead be authorized for direct sale and other initiatives.&#x20;

Specifically, DIP-6 previously authorized the DIMO Foundation to sell 5,000,000 $DIMO tokens to bring in resources to fund operations, as well as the ability to loan 50,000,000 $DIMO for market making activity.&#x20;

This proposal would redraw these allocations. If passed, the DIMO Foundation will be authorized to sell an additional 20,000,000 $DIMO to investors and strategic partners (25,000,000 total). Also, the authorization to loan tokens to market makers is cut in half to 25,000,000 $DIMO.&#x20;

The 5,000,000 $DIMO left over are unallocated and returned the treasury.

|                                        | Previous Allocation | New Allocation |
| -------------------------------------- | :-----------------: | :------------: |
| Available to be sold                   |      5,000,000      |   25,000,000   |
| Available to be used for market making |      50,000,000     |   25,000,000   |
| Returned back to the treasury          |                     |    5,000,000   |

## Motivation

The DIMO Foundation suggests that 25,000,000 $DIMO is sufficient to facilitate market making activities and that there will likely be opportunities to continue to sell meaningful amounts of $DIMO to investors and strategic partners at favorable prices to further diversify the treasury and ensure future funding for development.

## Specification

If passed, this proposal would edit the following section within the DIP-6 Specification section:&#x20;

\---

#### Treasury Initiatives

Additionally, this proposal authorizes the DIMO Foundation to sell up to <mark style="color:red;">25,000,000</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">5,000,000</mark>~~ $DIMO tokens and to loan up to <mark style="color:red;">25,000,000</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">50,000,000</mark>~~ $DIMO tokens to market makers.

<mark style="color:red;">The DIMO Foundation may not sell this specific pool of tokens below $0.30. A minimum one-year lockup is required on token sales unless there is a bona fide expectation that the purchaser will use a majority of those tokens themselves to use DIMO, such as to produce devices or operate a node.</mark>

The Foundation will make its best effort to balance regulatory, financial, and strategic considerations to maximize the long-term health of the DIMO protocol.

These tokens would come from the [unallocated treasury pool](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/token-details-and-distribution) of 250,000,000 $DIMO. <mark style="color:red;">This may be amended or deals on other terms (e.g., below $0.30) may be authorized by any valid governance vote.</mark>

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-6 would be updated as specified above after the four day timelock concludes and only once [dip1a1.md](dip1a1.md "mention") is enacted.

## Changelog

Feb 27, 2023: updated to include additional requirements on sales ($0.30 minimum and lockup).

Mar 3, 2023: adjusted the date that the proposal is in review from March 3 to March 15. This is to create more time discussion and hopefully the introduction of a fourth proposal related to marketplace issuance that can be voted alongside the three that are currently in review.

Mar 9, 2023: added clarification that these conditions may be amended. This was already the case, but extra specificity may reduce confusion.&#x20;

Mar 13, 2023: extended the review period from March 15 to March 22. This is to continue to provide more time for discussion and hopefully the introduction of a fourth proposal related to marketplace issuance that can be voted alongside the three that are currently in review.

Mar 14, 2023: added clarifying language that the restriction on price and lockup pertains to this pool of authorized tokens specifically.
