## Abstract

This proposal would repurpose tokens set aside for market making to instead be authorized for direct sale and other initiatives.&#x20;

Specifically, DIP-6 previously authorized the DIMO Foundation to sell 5,000,000 $DIMO tokens and loan 50,000,000 $DIMO for market making activity.&#x20;

This proposal would redraw these allocations such that the DIMO Foundation is authorized to sell 25,000,000 $DIMO to investors and strategic partners and is authorized to loan 25,000,000 $DIMO to market makers. The 5,000,000 $DIMO left over are unallocated and returned the treasury.

## Motivation

The DIMO Foundation suggests that 25,000,000 $DIMO is sufficient to facilitate market making activities and that there will likely be opportunities to continue to sell meaningful amounts of $DIMO to investors and strategic partners at favorable prices to further diversify the treasury and ensure future funding for development.

## Specification

If passed, this proposal would edit the following section within the DIP-6 Specification section:&#x20;
