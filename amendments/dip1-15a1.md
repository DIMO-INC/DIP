## Abstract

This DIP authorizes various common sense changes to formatting to keep this governance repository organized.

## Motivation

To keep DIMO governance easily understandable for everyone.

## Specification

Updates will be made as follows

1. The following DIPs will be retitled: DIP-7 to "Referrals", DIP-8 to "Ignite Grants", DIP-9 to "Marketing", and DIP-10 to "Hashdog Device Integration"
2. DIP-10 "[Steps to production](../license-proposals/dip10.md#steps-for-production-are-as-follows)" will be updated to reflect that these requirements were completed
3. Proposals related to issuing integrations and node licenses will be known as "DLPs", short for DIMO License Proposals, and will get their own section on the sidebar and governance hub. This means retitling the license proposal DIPs 10-14, and making small tweaks to earlier DIPs where needed to include mention of them. This does not change how governance and voting works for them, only what they're named.
4. The following will be added to every disclaimer:

> Certain statements in this document constitute forward-looking statements. The words “may,” “will,” “should,” “project,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “expect,” “continue,” and similar expressions or the negatives thereof are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, including the intended actions and performance objectives, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause the actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and nothing in this document represents a promise of specific work to be completed in the future.&#x20;

## Implementation

If passed, DIPs will be updated after the four day timelock concludes.
