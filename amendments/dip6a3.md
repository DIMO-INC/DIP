## Abstract

As currently written, [DIP-6](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip6) gives the DIMO Foundation the unilateral authority to sell up to 25,000,000 $DIMO tokens as needed at a minimum of $0.30 per token.

This amendment would replace these terms, authorizing a sale of tokens from the DIMO Treasury to Digital Infrastructure Inc., the entity which first donated DIMO intellectual property, cash, and $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation, and which continues to operate DIMO Mobile and contribute to the protocol‚Äôs development.&#x20;

Digital Infrastructure Inc. would repurchase 48,000,000 $DIMO tokens from the treasury at $0.11 per token, infusing the DIMO treasury with $5,280,000 USD. $0.11 is roughly 40% above market price as of the time of writing. These tokens would be subject to a mutually agreeable lockup.

It is the intention of both parties to execute the sale as quickly as possible, but transactions such as this are complicated and factors outside of the control of either party may prevent such a deal from closing, even if the proposal passes. Specifically, Digital Infrastructure Inc. is still in the process of raising capital required for the token acquisition.

Due to conflicts of interest, Digital Infrastructure Inc. investors and employees who hold $DIMO may only vote ‚Äúabstain‚Äù for this proposal.

## Motivation

The DIMO Foundation has an opportunity to lock-in millions of dollars in resources and rapidly accelerate development now, but current market conditions prevent $0.30 from being a realistic sale price. Selling 48,000,000 $DIMO tokens to Digital Infrastructure Inc. for $5,280,000 USD has two main benefits:

1. Diversifying the treasury with USD and USDC stablecoins would ensure long-term resources for the DIMO protocol regardless of short-term market fluctuations; and
2. The DIMO community would be able to fund grants and other initiatives in a way that does not impact markets when they are distributed (does not require the DIMO Foundation or recipient to sell $DIMO).

## Specification

_<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would edit the following section within the DIP-6 Specification section:</mark>_&#x20;

**Treasury Initiatives**

~~<mark style="color:red;">Additionally, t</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">T</mark>his proposal authorizes the DIMO Foundation to ~~<mark style="color:red;">sell up to 25,000,000 $DIMO tokens and to</mark>~~ loan up to 25,000,000 $DIMO tokens to market makers.

<mark style="color:red;">Additionally, for a period of 120 days following the passage of this proposal, the DIMO Foundation is authorized to sell up to 48,000,000 $DIMO to Digital Infrastructure Inc. for $0.11 per token for a total sum of up to $5,280,000 USD. These tokens would be subject to a mutually agreeable lockup. The purpose of this sale is to diversify the DIMO treasury and provide resources for long-term development.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">The DIMO Foundation has already sold 833,333.33 $DIMO tokens at $0.30 in accordance with the original language of this governance proposal.</mark> ~~<mark style="color:red;">The DIMO Foundation may not sell this specific pool of tokens below $0.30. A minimum one-year lockup is required on token sales unless there is a bona fide expectation that the purchaser will use a majority of those tokens themselves to use DIMO, such as to produce devices or operate a node.</mark>~~

The Foundation will make its best effort to balance regulatory, financial, and strategic considerations to maximize the long-term health of the DIMO protocol.~~<mark style="color:red;">¬∂</mark>~~ These tokens would come from the [unallocated treasury pool](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/token-details-and-distribution) of 250,000,000 $DIMO. ~~<mark style="color:red;">This may be amended or deals on other terms (e.g., below $0.30) may be authorized by any valid governance vote.</mark>~~

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-6 would be updated as specified above after the four day timelock concludes and the DIMO Foundation would work with Digital Infrastructure Inc. to conduct the token sale promptly.
