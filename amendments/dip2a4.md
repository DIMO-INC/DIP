## Abstract

This amendment gives users the ability to lock up $DIMO tokens to increase their weekly baseline earnings. A user who locks $DIMO in a specified quantity for a specified duration will receive a rewards boost similar to the Streak Level bonus.

The "Lock" boost is similar to the Streak boost, whereby there are four levels that offer 0, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 extra weekly points respectively. The Lock Level is determined by the quantity and duration that user locks their $DIMO. This boost is created on a per vehicle basis.

## Motivation

Baseline rewards exist to incentivize the development of a large and incentive-aligned network. A DIMO user who accumulates and retains large quantities of $DIMO will inevitably be a more aligned network participant than someone who is not.&#x20;

## Specification

<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would incorporate the following changes to the Specifications section of DIP-2. These changes build off of DIP-2 amendment 3, assuming this passes. If it fails, the related changes to integration methods would be rolled back and only those new changes shown below will be incorporated:</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Note that:</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Streak Levels**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: are tied to the vehicle, which means that swapping out an OBD device or transferring a vehicle to another user will preserve the level for that car; a streak cannot be transferred from one car to another; and vehicles that fail to connect for three consecutive weeks will fall back one streak level.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Lock Levels**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: are per vehicle (e.g., it would take 8,000 $DIMO to boost two separate vehicles to level 4); may be assigned and unassigned to any car in your account; and can be upgraded at any time, but cannot be downgraded prematurely (e.g., you can roll 500 $DIMO from a level 1 contract that is still locked, add 1,000 more $DIMO, and upgrade it to a new level 2 contract that restarts the lock period).</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**Connection types**</mark><mark style="color:red;">: to be considered "comprehensive", an integration must send extensive telemetry data in near real-time. As of the last update of this proposal, the AutoPi, LTE R1 and native Tesla connections qualify as "comprehensive" integrations.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">Every box depicting points can stack on one another. This means that a car can have a streak level, a boost level, a software connection, and hardware connection for a maximum 16,000 weekly points. A car must send valid data to qualify for rewards in a given week. If a car isn't driven, it will receive zero $DIMO regardless of any streak or boost.</mark>

~~<mark style="color:red;">To be considered "Comprehensive", an integration must send extensive telemetry data in near real-time.</mark>~~

~~<mark style="color:red;">Users who fail to connect for three consecutive weeks will fall back one level.</mark>~~

In the example shown in the table above, Alice earns 2,000 points for having been connected between 21 to 35 weeks, <mark style="color:red;">1,000 points for locking 500 $DIMO for 6 months,</mark> 1,000 points for her Limited software connection, and 6,000 points for having comprehensive installed in her vehicle.

Here there are 40,000 cars connected to DIMO and each car generates an average of 6,000 points that week, for a total of 240,000,000 points. Alice's <mark style="color:red;">10</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">9</mark>~~,000 points represent 0.004% of the points for that week (<mark style="color:red;">10</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">9</mark>~~,000 √∑ 240,000,000). Therefore, she earns <mark style="color:red;">46.04</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">41.44</mark>~~ out of the 1,105,000 tokens from this pool (1,105,000 \* 0.004%).

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-2 would be updated and these changes implemented once the code is ready, or after the four day timelock, whichever is later. This would be expected to launch by the end of 2024 or early 2025.
