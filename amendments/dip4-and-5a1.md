## Abstract

This proposal alters the terminology used in DIP-4 and DIP-5 to replace the term "staking" with "bonding".

## Motivation

Many are confused by the term "staking" as used in DIP-4 and DIP-5. "Staking" in the context of blockchain projects usually refers to an activity whereby users lock up tokens for the purposes of earning a yield.

In DIP-4 and DIP-5, "staking" refers to hardware manufacturers, node operators, and client publishers putting up tokens as a security deposit as a condition of receiving a license. There is no yield for staking.

This amendment proposes using the term "bonding" instead.

## Specification

If passed, this proposal would replace every instance of "stake" with "bond", "staking" with "bonding", "staked" with "bonded", and "staker" with "licensee" in DIP-4 and DIP-5.

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-4 and DIP-5 would be updated as specified above after the four day timelock concludes.
