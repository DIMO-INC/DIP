## Abstract

[Ruptela](https://www.ruptela.com/) is a global telematics company established in 2007 in Lithuania. Ruptela develops quality devices in-house, working with clients in over 120 countries. Ruptela is applying for a integration license to produce a DIMO-compatible high bandwidth OBD dongle that uses LTE connectivity with 2G fallback.

## Motivation

This proposal provides transparency to the DIMO community regarding the new DIMO-compatible hardware that Ruptela is planning to bring to the ecosystem and specifies the commitments they must uphold.&#x20;

Granting licenses to new manufacturers broadens the ecosystem and fosters competition with different options for performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Different manufacturers may bring innovative approaches and technologies to the table and reduce single points of failure for the network over time.&#x20;

Due to its compact size, wider vehicle signal support, and connectivity options, the device specified below will bring a lower and more affordable price point for the cost of ownership and connectivity for users to connect to the DIMO network.

## Specification

Ruptela has applied to manufacture DIMO-compatible devices and is currently in the Hardware Ecosystem Pipeline. The company has passed KYC, produced 1,000 devices, and bonded 100,000 $DIMO as part of the application process.

#### **Steps for production are as follows:**

* **Complete**: KYC/B and business audit of the manufacturer, and ongoing orders
* [**Complete**](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xbf51e75db33e862798f5d577605159f7460fdc5921a594400bb0721376918781): Bond 100,000 $DIMO to acquire a manufacturing license[ as outlined in DIP-4](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip4#licenses-and-bonding)
* **Complete**: Radio/industrial certifications
  * FCC
  * IC
  * PTCRB
  * UKCA
  * CE
* **Within 1 year**: Hardware and security audit

### Safety Protocols

The device employs the use of a ‚Äòsecure element‚Äô that provides communication encryption between the device and the cloud. Data is stored onboard on a flash chip. The device is able to sense the vehicle's acceleration/orientation, track location (both GSM triangulation and GPS), and connect to the vehicle's OBD II port.

### Commitments to DIMO

Ruptela is committed to:

* Act in best faith towards the DIMO community, producing quality hardware and honoring any commitments, timelines, etc.; and
* Comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to the safe production and usage of their devices.

## Implementation

If passed, this DLP will be in effect immediately after the four-day timelock concludes. Ruptela will have the ability to mint valid $DIMO devices. This DLP will be updated, with history noted in the [Changelog](dlp5.md#changelog), if the bond is ever updated.
