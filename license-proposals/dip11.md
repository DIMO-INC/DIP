## Abstract

AutoPi.io ApS is a company that produces advanced Internet of Things (IoT) devices based on the Raspberry Pi‚Ñ¢ and an extendable cloud platform for vehicles. Their flagship product, the AutoPi, is an LTE OBDII enabled device that is able to transmit vehicle data, in addition to collecting data from onboard sensors. AutoPi is applying for a Manufacturing License to continue producing a DIMO compatible OBD devices.

## Motivation

[AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io/)‚Äôs temporary hardware manufacturing license has expired and as per [DIP 4](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/\~/changes/BVHxKwYX8U5GDtrtGJCU/improvement-proposals/dip4), this proposal serves as a review of their application for a permanent hardware manufacturing license. Additionally, this proposal provides transparency to the DIMO community regarding the new DIMO-compatible hardware that AutoPi.io is already delivering to the ecosystem, and specifies the commitments they must uphold as licensed hardware manufacturer.

## Specification

AutoPi.io has submitted an application to continue to manufacture and support DIMO-compatible devices. Over 13,000 devices have been sold to customers on the DIMO network. From DIMO's early days, AutoPi has been a key partner with DIMO in providing functional devices quickly.

#### **Steps for production are as follows:**

* **Complete**: KYC/B and business audit of the manufacturer, and ongoing orders
* [**Complete**](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x7420ce4c6e391fe451a004c32cc22b529195ce0bf3472ae840e6f9590e102c29): Bond 100,000 $DIMO to acquire a manufacturing license[ as outlined in DIP-4](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip4#licenses-and-bonding)
* **Complete**: Radio/industrial certifications
  * EN 301 489-1 v2.2.0,&#x20;
  * EN55025:2008,&#x20;
  * EN 50498/ Directive 2004/104/EC
  * ISO 7637-2:2011&#x20;
  * EN 301 489-3 V2.1.1
  * FCC 47 CFR Part 15, Class A:10‚Äì1‚Äì17 Edition
* **Complete**: Web API audit

### Safety Protocols

The device employs the use of a ‚Äòsecure element‚Äô that provides communication encryption between the device and the cloud. Data is stored onboard.

### Commitments to DIMO

AutoPi is committed to:

* Act in best faith towards the DIMO community, producing quality hardware and honoring any commitments, timelines, etc.; and
* Comply with all relevant laws and regulations related to the safe production and usage of their devices.

## Implementation

If passed, this DIP will be in effect immediately after the four day timelock concludes. AutoPi will have the ability to mint valid $DIMO devices, so long as they maintain this license. This DIP will be updated, with history noted in the [Changelog](dip11.md#changelog), if the bond is ever updated.
