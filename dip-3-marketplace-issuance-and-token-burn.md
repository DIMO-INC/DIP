### Abstract

Marketplace Issuance rewards drivers based on what third parties are paying for their data.

It will start off very simple, but should evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves. The DIMO Foundation will collect proceeds and incentives from licensed applications, distribute additional $DIMO to users, and burn a small portion of token.

### Motivation

DIMO users should be rewarded primarily based on the value that they generate to create a more direct link between incentivizes and optimal behaviors. Those who create the most value for the network should have the biggest voice

In the early stages of DIMO's development, the vast majority of rewards will come from [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md), which is designed to simulate market demand for user data in the simplest way possible. As the network matures, this balance will likely shift the other way and the majority of rewards will come from Marketplace Issuance. This is comparable to other web3 networks like Helium, where their rewards from proof of coverage ideally shrink in comparison to rewards from data transfer as adoption increase.

### Specification

For now, there are two ways users will be able to earn $DIMO from market issuance. The first is by the sale of user data and the second is by direct incentive from an application.

#### **From the sale of data**

Licensed DIMO applications may sell access to DIMO user data and connectivity according to: the terms of that user's opt-in; a predefined revenue split; and the other terms as may be specified by the process outlined in [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md).

The calculation is designed to keep things simple at this early point in the maturation of DIMO and blockchain industry as a whole. For each US dollar or $DIMO token sent to the foundation from such sales, 0.99 $DIMO will go to users and 0.01 $DIMO will be burnt.

Marketplace Issuance generated by the sale of aggregate and anonymized is split evenly among all users who are currently opted into and contributing data to that data pool. For example, reports on aggregate traffic data, battery health, self-driving performance, road quality, and cell coverage generate $100,000 in proceeds for the DIMO Foundation, 99,000 $DIMO will be issued to participating users and 1,000 $DIMO will be burned.

Marketplace Issuance generated by the direct sale of user data will go directly to the participating user. For example, if an advertising firm pays $15 per month to subscribe to your data to serve you relevant ads, the Foundation will hold the cash, the user will receive 14.85 $DIMO per month, and the remaining 0.15 will be burned.

Users may earn additional $DIMO when they use marketplace apps. The amount and terms will vary as specified by the app developer and agreed to by users so long as the reward is remitted in $DIMO and 1% is burned. The Foundation can accept cash and remit $DIMO on the apps behalf if the app developer prefers not to interact with $DIMO directly.

DINC will keep 3% and remit the rest in kind

Licensed apps must pay all user referral bonuses to DIMO Foundation

Data sales = split among everyone. Add per user payment in the future. Add node subscription in the future.

### Implementation

In order to enact the specification above, the DIMO Foundation will issue licenses to DIMO applications, per [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md), that specify the terms by which those applications handle user data and remit cash or $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation.
