## Abstract

Marketplace Issuance rewards drivers based on what third parties are paying for their data.

It will start off very simple, but should evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves. Payments from at to licensed applications will generate distributions of additional $DIMO rewards to users and burn a small portion of token.

## Motivation

DIMO users should be rewarded primarily based on the value that they generate to create a more direct link between incentivizes and optimal behaviors. Those who create the most value for the network should have the biggest voice and should have an easier path to using DIMO.

In the early stages of DIMO's development, the vast majority of rewards will come from [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md), which is designed to simulate market demand for user data in the simplest way possible. As the network matures, this balance will likely shift the other way and the majority of rewards will come from Marketplace Issuance. This is comparable to other web3 networks like Helium, where their rewards from proof of coverage ideally shrink in comparison to rewards from data transfer as adoption increase.

## Specification

The Market Issuance and Token Burn mechanism is designed to keep things simple at this early point in the maturation of DIMO and blockchain industry as a whole. For convenience, any party may send USD or other money-like assets (EUR, DAI, USDC, ETH, BTC, etc.) to the DIMO Foundation where it will be converted at the rate of 1 $DIMO per 1 US Dollar.

Listed below are the transaction types that generate additional Marketplace Issuance and $DIMO token burn.

### Type 1: The sale of aggregate and anonymized user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the sale of aggregate and anonymized is split evenly among all users who are currently opted into and contributing data to that data pool. 99% of net proceeds are issued to users and 1% is burned.

_Example:_ You grant Acme, a licensed DIMO app, the right to sell your aggregate and anonymized data. As a part of the licensing process, they have agreed to a 10% revenue split. It generates $1,000,000 USD by selling reports on overall traffic patterns, battery performance, self-driving system usage, road quality, and other driving behaviors.

&#x20;$900,000 goes to the DIMO Foundation; 891,000 $DIMO is issued to participating users (900,000 \* 99%); and 9,000 $DIMO will be burned (900,000 \* 1%).

### Type 2: The sale of disaggregated user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the direct sale of user data will go to the respective user. 99% of net proceeds are issued to the user and 1% is burned.

_Example:_ You grant DataWiz, a licensed DIMO App, the right to sell your anonymized but disaggregated (vehicle specific data). Specifically, you share trip telemetry data and vehicle status, but not location or glovebox (license, title, insurance) data. DataWiz's license agreement gives them a 5% revenue split.

Verizon subscribers to your cell coverage data so they can map their signal strength. Panasonic subscribes to your batter data. Other businesses subscribe to similar streams and DataWiz receives an aggregate $60/month from brokering your data.

DataWiz keeps $3 ($60 \* 5%) and $57 goes to the DIMO Foundation ($60 \* 95%). You personally receive 56.43 $DIMO (57 \* 99%) and 0.57 $DIMO (57 \* 1%) is burned

### Type 3: Direct incentives

Marketplace Issuance may also be earned directly from apps. Incentives must be in $DIMO. 99% of the incentive is issued to the user and 1% is burned.

_Example:_ All Farm Insurance gives new customers 500 $DIMO when they switch to All Farm and share their vehicle health, location, and mileage data for better insurance rates. After you sign up, they send 505.05 $DIMO or USD to the DIMO Foundation, 500 $DIMO is sent to you (505.05 \* 99% = 500) and 5.05 $DIMO is burned (505.05 \* 1% = 5.05).

### Type 4: User payments to licensed apps

Users may pay licensed DIMO apps for services and subscriptions in fiat dollars or $DIMO. This still generates market issuance for the user and a token burn. 1% of the payment comes back to the user in $DIMO and 1% is burned.

_Example_: Thanks to the data you provide All Farm through DIMO, you save a lot of money on your car insurance, but, unfortunately, it's still not free. After safe driving discounts, you pay $50 in cash per month for your car insurance.

All Farm receives your $50 and sends $1 USD or 1 $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation who sends 0.5  $DIMO back to you (50 \* 1%) and burns 0.5 (50 \* 1%).

### Type 5: User providing professional services

_When users are providing professional services, they are eligible to receive 98% of qualified payments in cash rather than $DIMO. Of the remaining 2%, half is distributed as a $DIMO reward and half is burned._

_Example_: You drive for a better DIMO-fied version of Uber and a passenger pays $40 in cash for you to drive them to the airport. You receive $39.60 ($40 \* 99%) in cash and 0.20 $DIMO tokens (40 \* 1%). 0.20 $DIMO is burned (40 \* 1%).

## Implementation

In order to enact the specification above, the DIMO Foundation will issue licenses to DIMO applications, per [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md), that specify the terms by which those applications handle user data and remit cash or $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation.

The DIMO Foundation has engaged Digital Infrastructure Inc. to assist in the calculations and distributions pertaining to Market Issuance and Token Burn
