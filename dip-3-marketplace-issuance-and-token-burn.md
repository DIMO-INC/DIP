## Abstract

Marketplace Issuance rewards drivers based on what third parties are paying for their data.

It will start off very simple, but should evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves. The DIMO Foundation will collect proceeds and incentives from licensed applications, distribute additional $DIMO to users, and burn a small portion of token.

Additionally, any payments that flow in reverse, from users to licensed apps, whether paid in cash or tokens, will generate a small burn of $DIMO.

## Motivation

DIMO users should be rewarded primarily based on the value that they generate to create a more direct link between incentivizes and optimal behaviors. Those who create the most value for the network should have the biggest voice and should have an easier path to using DIMO.

In the early stages of DIMO's development, the vast majority of rewards will come from [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md), which is designed to simulate market demand for user data in the simplest way possible. As the network matures, this balance will likely shift the other way and the majority of rewards will come from Marketplace Issuance. This is comparable to other web3 networks like Helium, where their rewards from proof of coverage ideally shrink in comparison to rewards from data transfer as adoption increase.

## Specification

Licensed DIMO applications may sell access to DIMO user data and connectivity according to: the terms of that user's opt-in; a predefined revenue split; and other terms set by the completion of the process defined in [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md).

The calculation is designed to keep things simple at this early point in the maturation of DIMO and blockchain industry as a whole. For each US dollar or $DIMO token sent to the foundation from such sales, 0.99 $DIMO will go to users and 0.01 $DIMO will be burnt.

Listed below are the transaction types that generate additional Marketplace Issuance and/or $DIMO token burn.

### Type 1: The sale of aggregate and anonymized user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the sale of aggregate and anonymized is split evenly among all users who are currently opted into and contributing data to that data pool.&#x20;

_Example:_ **** You grant Acme, a licensed DIMO app, the right to sell your aggregate and anonymized data. As a part of the licensing process, they have agreed to a 10% revenue split. It generates $1,000,000 USD by selling reports on overall traffic patterns, battery performance, self-driving system usage, road quality, and other driving behaviors.

&#x20;$900,000 goes to the DIMO Foundation; 891,000 $DIMO is issued to participating users (900,000 \* 99%); and 9,000 $DIMO will be burned (900,000 \* 1%).

### Type 2: The sale of disaggregated user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the direct sale of user data will go to the respective user.

_Example:_ You grant DataWiz, a licensed DIMO App, the right to sell your anonymized but vehicle specific data. Specifically, you share trip telemetry data and vehicle status, but not location or glovebox (license, title, insurance) data. DataWiz's license agreement gives them a 5% revenue split.

Verizon subscribers to your cell coverage data so they can map their signal strength. Panasonic subscribes to your batter data. Other businesses subscribe to similar streams and DataWiz receives an aggregate $60/month from brokering your data.

DataWiz keeps $3 ($60 \* 5%) and $57 goes to the DIMO Foundation ($60 \* 95%). You personally receive 56.43 $DIMO (57 \* 99%) and 0.57 $DIMO (57 \* 1%) is burned

### Type 3: Direct incentives

Marketplace Issuance may also be issued directly by apps and incentives must be in $DIMO or subscription credit.

_Example:_ All Farm Insurance gives new users 500 $DIMO when they switch to All Farm and share telemetry data for better insurance rates.&#x20;

### Type 4: User payments to licensed apps



your auto lender pays $10 per month to subscribe to the health of your vehicle

from the sale of aggregate and anonymized data

who have opted in to data sales as a part of the vehicle pairing process

Users may earn additional $DIMO when they use marketplace apps. The amount and terms will vary as specified by the app developer and agreed to by users so long as the reward is remitted in $DIMO and 1% is burned. The Foundation can accept cash and remit $DIMO on the apps behalf if the app developer prefers not to interact with $DIMO directly.

DINC will keep 3% and remit the rest in kind

Licensed apps must pay all user referral bonuses to DIMO Foundation

Data sales = split among everyone. Add per user payment in the future. Add node subscription in the future.

Revenue split to broker

## Implementation

In order to enact the specification above, the DIMO Foundation will issue licenses to DIMO applications, per [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md), that specify the terms by which those applications handle user data and remit cash or $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation.
