## Abstract

Transactions enabled by DIMO apps, such as data sales and subscriptions, generate additional $DIMO rewards for apps and users, known as Marketplace Issuance. This is in addition to [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md). These transactions will also generate a $DIMO token burn.&#x20;

It will start off very simple, but can evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves.

## Motivation

DIMO users and apps should be rewarded based on the value that they generate to create a more direct link between incentives and optimal behaviors. Those who create the most value for the network should have the largest $DIMO earnings and biggest voice in its future direction.

In the early stages of DIMO's development, the vast majority of rewards will come from [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md), which is designed to simulate market demand for user data in the simplest way possible. As the network matures, this balance will shift so the majority of rewards come from Marketplace Issuance. This is comparable to other web3 networks like Helium, where their rewards from proof of coverage ideally shrink in comparison to rewards from data transfer as adoption increase.

## Specification

All transactions enabled by DIMO apps, where fiat money, money-like instruments (DAI, BTC, ETH), or $DIMO is exchanged, generate rewards and token burn.

For all such transactions, 1% of revenue is burned as $DIMO, and:&#x20;

* _If user is selling data or receiving a sign up bonus —_ 99% (the remainder) goes to the user in $DIMO regardless of payment type.
* _If user is providing or paying for goods or services_ — 1% goes to the user in $DIMO and the rest is remitted in kind.

For these calculations specifically, $1 DIMO is pegged to 1 USD of value.&#x20;

The easiest way to understand this mechanism is through examples of various transaction types, all listed below.

### Type 1: The sale of aggregate and anonymized user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the sale of aggregate and anonymized data is split evenly among all users who are currently opted into and contributing data to that data pool.

_Hypothetical Example:_ You grant DIMO Explorer, a licensed DIMO app, the right to sell your aggregate and anonymized data when you opt-in to Baseline Rewards. As a part of the opt-in, users agree that Explorer keeps a 10% cut for their efforts, leaving users with 90%. In 2023, Explorer generates $1,000,000 in USD by selling reports on overall traffic patterns, battery performance, self-driving system usage, road quality, and other driving behaviors.

* **Burn**: 10,000 $DIMO (1,000,000 x 1%)
* **Settlement**:&#x20;
  * Explorer receives $99,000 USD (1,000,000 x 99% x 10%)
  * Users receive 891,000 $DIMO (1,000,000 x 99% x 90%)

### Type 2: The sale of disaggregated user data

Marketplace Issuance generated by the direct sale of user data will go to the respective user. 99% of net proceeds are issued to the user and 1% is burned.

_Hypothetical Example:_ You grant DataWiz, a DIMO App, the right to sell your anonymized but disaggregated (vehicle specific data). Specifically, you share trip telemetry data and vehicle status, but not location or glovebox (license, title, insurance) data. DataWiz's license agreement gives them a 5% revenue split.

Verizon subscribes to your cell coverage data so they can map their signal strength. Panasonic subscribes to your battery data. Other businesses subscribe to similar streams and DataWiz receives an aggregate $60/month in USD from brokering your data.

* **Burn**: 0.60 $DIMO each month (60 x 1%)
* **Settlement**:&#x20;
  * DataWiz receives $2.97/month USD (60 x 99% x 5%)
  * You receive 56.43 $DIMO per month (60 x 99% x 95%)

### Type 3: Direct incentives

Marketplace Issuance may also be earned directly from apps. Incentives must be in $DIMO. 99% of the incentive is issued to the user and 1% is burned.&#x20;

_Hypothetical Example:_ All Farm Insurance gives new customers 500 $DIMO when they switch to All Farm and share their vehicle health, location, and mileage data for better insurance rates.

* **Burn**: 5.05 $DIMO (505.05 x 1%)
* **Settlement**:&#x20;
  * You receive 500 $DIMO (505.05 x 99%)

### Type 4: User payments to licensed apps

Users may pay licensed DIMO apps for services and subscriptions in fiat dollars or $DIMO. This still generates market issuance for the user and a token burn. 1% of the payment comes back to the user in $DIMO and 1% is burned.

_Hypothetical Example_: Thanks to the data you provide to All Farm through DIMO, you save a lot of money on your car insurance, but, unfortunately, it's still not free. After safe driving discounts, you pay $50 in cash per month for your car insurance.

* **Burn**: 0.50 $DIMO (50 x 1%)
* **Settlement**:&#x20;
  * All Farm receives $49.50 USD (50 x 99%)

### Type 5: User providing professional services

_When users are providing professional services, they are eligible to receive 98% of qualified payments in cash rather than $DIMO. Of the remaining 2%, half is distributed as a $DIMO reward and half is burned._

_Hypothetical Example_: You drive for, RID3SHAR3, a better DIMO-fied version of Uber that charges a 2% fee (compare with Uber's \~25% fee). A passenger pays $40 USD for you to drive them to the airport.

* **Burn**: 0.40 $DIMO (40 x 1%)
* **Settlement**:&#x20;
  * RID3SHAR3 receives $0.79 (40 \* 99% \* 2%)
  * You receive 0.39 $DIMO (40 \* 99% \* 98% x 1%) plus $38.42 USD (40 \* 99% \* 98% x 99%)

## Implementation

In order to enact the specification above, the DIMO Foundation will issue licenses to DIMO applications, per [DIP-5](dip-5-app-ecosystem.md), that specify the terms by which those applications handle user data and remit cash or $DIMO to the DIMO Foundation.

DIMO apps may burn and distribute $DIMO directly. In cases where DIMO apps do not have or wish to use $DIMO, or do not wish to handle the distribution directly, the DIMO Foundation will assist in conversions and distributions. To assist in this matter, the DIMO Foundation has engaged Digital Infrastructure Inc. to process data and calculate distributions.
