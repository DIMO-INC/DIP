# DIMO Governance Hub

_This page contains information on how holders of the $DIMO token vote to control how the protocol works. Read on to learn how to participate and view proposals you can vote on now, as well as past proposals. For more on why voting is important, click_ [_here_](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/user-ownership)_._&#x20;

### **Instructions**

There are steps you must take in order to vote. **** To have your tokens counted you must "delegate" your voting power to someone. **Even if you want to vote with your own tokens, you still must delegate them to yourself.**&#x20;

We recommend using [this website](https://delegate.dimo.zone/) to easily delegate to yourself or others. On this page click "Connect Wallet" and sign in with a wallet that contains $DIMO. We recommend using a mobile wallet (Metamask desktop is not supported). Then:

* _To be able to vote on a proposal yourself using the wallet you just connected_, click "Delegate to myself" in the top right and execute the transaction in your wallet
* _To delegate your voting power to someone we recommend_, click the "Delegate" button under that person name on their card, click "Confirm", then execute the transaction in your wallet
* _To delegate your voting power to anyone else_, enter their wallet address in the large input field at the top, click the "Delegate" button right next to it, then execute the transaction in your wallet

### Pending and Past Proposals

Below, you can see active proposals that $DIMO token holders can vote on now, proposals that are receiving feedback and aren't ready for voting yet, and the entire index of all DIPs passed and failed.
