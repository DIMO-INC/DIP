# DIMO Pay

## Abstract

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

DIMO Pay is a service that converts fiat to crypto using services like Wyre or Transak, swaps between tokens, and splits payments to extract the protocol fee and automatically route payment to users. It also enables subscriptions and incentive programs.

For example, a node may charge an application $1 USD per connected vehicle for 10,000 vehicles as a monthly subscription. That application enters their credit card and pays $10,000, which is then converted to $DIMO and automatically split: $500 worth of $DIMO to the node operator; $100 worth of $DIMO to the DIMO protocol; and $9,400 worth of $DIMO to the 10,000 drivers.

Payments and subscriptions may flow back the other way as well. Apps may charge users for features and services. These payments also flow back through DIMO Pay with 1% of the transaction flowing to the DIMO Treasury and the rest going to the application.

Modeled after the [Braintrust Fee Converter](https://medium.com/snowfork/introducing-the-braintrust-fee-converter-21be7c8af951), this ensures revenue generated by DIMO aggregate data licenses are shared directly with users (similar to a reward point), while also benefiting token owners as a whole.
