## Abstract

This DIP allocates funds from the DIMO Treasury to Digital Infrastructure Inc. to help further the team's efforts to onboard new users onto the DIMO protocol and grow engagement. It explains the goals, restrictions, and responsibilities that come with this allocation.&#x20;

It also allocates a maximum pool of tokens that can be used for "learn" or "quest" related programming.

While [DIP-8](dip8.md) establishes a team for issuing grants, this proposal is being voted on separately due to its magnitude. The combined size of the grants allocation is up to 44,000,000 $DIMO split into tranches contingent on hitting specific milestones.

## Motivation

The goal of this proposal is to deploy resources to increase the velocity of onboarding new users onto the DIMO network by driving brand awareness, growing and educating the community, helping establish a presence in new markets, and more. As DIMO broadens its reach, more cars will connect and more developers will build, accelerating the flywheel. &#x20;

## Specification

### Team Name

Digital Infrastructure Inc.'s Growth Team

### Purpose & Mission

1. **Incentivize user adoption:** Create initiatives that educate and encourage new users to join the DIMO protocol and try its services. This can drive sustained user adoption and increase overall engagement with the project.
2. **Increase brand awareness:** Work to raise awareness of the DIMO protocol, ensuring that the brand is consistently and effectively communicated across different platforms in a trusted manner.
3. **Develop and manage partnerships:** Establish and maintain strategic partnerships with influencers, affiliates, and other relevant organizations to help expand DIMO’s reach, amplify its messaging, and build its credibility.
4. **Expand DIMO’s footprint into new regional markets:** Expansion presents several unique challenges ranging from prioritization, marketing, localization, demand for specific services, etc, that we will seek to push forward.

### Execution Plan & Team Operating Structure

Digital Infrastructure Inc and associated contractors will achieve its purpose through a combination of initiatives, ranging from blog posts, tweets, podcasts, incentive programs, media appearances, event sponsorships, quest programs, community moderation, and more.&#x20;

This team is uniquely qualified given their proven track record of growing the DIMO protocol to date (over 12,500 cars connected), their extensive growth/marketing experience, and domain knowledge across connected vehicles and web3. This team has also proven to act in good faith of the DIMO community.&#x20;

### Operating Goals & Metrics

This proposal acknowledges the responsibility that comes with funding and the use of the DIMO brand. The team intends to rigorously evaluate initiatives that drive core metrics and build trust with the community.

Some key initiatives include additional user token incentive programs; affiliate and brand partnerships; content and thought leadership; paid advertising and SEO; and funding DIMO quests on platforms such as Coinbase Learning Rewards, Layer3, or others.

**While subject to change, the focus is on managing specific metrics that tie directly to the mandate:**

### Financial Plan & Ask

#### **Budget**

**Funding Initiatives:** This proposal sets aside a pool of up to 44,000,000 $DIMO. For the avoidance of doubt, this pool of funds is for marketing initiatives and not to be used for payment to Digital Infrastructure Inc with the exception of the compensation specified below.

These tokens would come from the[ unallocated treasury pool](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/token-details-and-distribution) of $DIMO and any additional future funding would require another DIP. If Digital Infrastructure Inc. wishes to fund marketing initiatives with a mix of $DIMO and stable tokens/fiat, they may sell a portion of their $DIMO allocation, so long as they do so at market price on exchange or within 10% of current market price OTC / private placement.

In the event of non-compliance or ineffective performance the DIMO Foundation, acting in good faith, or $DIMO token holders via governance vote, may call this allocation back. Digital Infrastructure Inc. agrees to honor such a request promptly.

**Compensating the team:** For 12 months, or until amended by a governance vote, Digital Infrastructure Inc. will receive $10,000 USD equivalent in $DIMO as a flat monthly fee for providing this service ($120,000 USD equivalent total). This will come out of the budget specified above and will come in place of the $150/hr compensation that could have been paid to Digital Infrastructure growth team personnel as specified in [DIP-6](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/dip6).

Funding for ecosystem marketing initiatives will be unlocked in tranches as described below.

<table><thead><tr><th width="155">Tranche 1</th><th width="136.33333333333331">Amount</th><th>Unlock Criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tranche 1</td><td>7M $DIMO</td><td>Unlocked once DIP-9 Passes.</td></tr><tr><td>Tranche 2</td><td>7M $DIMO</td><td>Unlocked once 50,000 vehicles IDs minted on-chain.</td></tr><tr><td>Tranche 3</td><td>10M $DIMO</td><td>Only to be used for "quest" or "learn" style programs whereby participants must perform some action (e.g., mint their car, complete an quiz about DIMO, etc.) to earn a small reward.</td></tr><tr><td>Tranche 4</td><td>20M $DIMO</td><td><p>Similar to Tranche 3, these tokens are only to be unlocked for "quest" or "learn" programs, but may only  be used with Coinbase's Learning Rewards platform.</p><p></p><p>Coinbase Learning Rewards allows the roughly 100,000,000 Coinbase users to earn $DIMO by completing informative quizzes and quests (e.g., mint your car, share your car, use an app).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Authority & Domain

#### **Utilize intellectual property and represent the brand**

The operating team may utilize the DIMO IP, such as trademarks and web domains, owned by the DIMO Foundation. It may also engage with partners/affiliates on DIMO’s behalf.&#x20;

Specifically, this team will have exclusive control over:

* The official DIMO [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dimo\_network), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dimo\_network/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@dimo\_network), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@dimo\_network)
* The official [DIMO Blog Platform](https://dimo.zone/news)
* The ability to create new official content channels

This team is not asking for the authority to limit the ability of community members to form unofficial groups and channels, write about DIMO, speak on podcasts, form communities, organize meetups, etc.&#x20;

### Commitments to DIMO

Digital Infrastructure Inc is committed to:

* Act honorably and in the best interest of the protocol
* Avoid conflicts of interest
* Assist other teams in promoting their various activities through official channels
* Strive to maximize transparency by providing community updates including:
  * Specific incentive program performance (if applicable);
  * $DIMO and stable tokens spent and amount left in the pool; and
  * Reporting on relevant growth marketing metrics that Digital Infrastructure Inc is already tracking.&#x20;

### Key Risks

There is an element of uncertainty regarding the impact of various initiatives on customer acquisition and brand perception. However, this risk is a necessary one, as it enables the brand to establish its presence, reach its target audience, and achieve long-term success. Funding growth initiatives is common amongst other reputable and successful blockchain communities.&#x20;

## Implementation

If passed, the team will immediately begin working towards its mandates. The initial token allocation of 7,000,000 $DIMO will be allocated via the DIMO Foundation after the four-day timelock concludes.
