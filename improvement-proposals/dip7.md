## Abstract

This proposal re-establishes a formal referral program for DIMO users.

When one user refers another user who connects their first car to DIMO, both parties will receive 50 $DIMO at the end of the that week as a one-time bonus at roughly the same time as their baseline rewards. Referral bonuses will be available until the $DIMO token allocation runs out or the program is amended by a future governance vote.

## Motivation

This referral program is designed to accelerate new user onboarding, while also rewarding existing users for their continued support.

## Specification

#### Establishing a $DIMO pool for referral bonuses

This proposal sets aside a pool of 2,500,000 $DIMO to fund this referral program, meaning that only the first 25,000 referrals will earn this reward (2,500,000 $DIMO / 50 $DIMO \* 2 users per referral). This proposal may be amended by a future governance vote to top off this pool or otherwise alter referrals.&#x20;

Any user, whether they've connected a car or not, is eligible to generate a unique six digit referral code or referral link within the DIMO Mobile app or any other app approved by the DIMO Foundation. This code or link can be shared intimately (text it directly to a friend) or broadly (Tweeted out to the world). The referrer's personal information is not ascertainable from the referral code itself, although it's possible that in certain circumstances another user would be able to guess the blockchain address of the referrer by auditing the on-chain payout.

_Any user can refer multiple new users and earn the bonus for each new user._

**Being referred**

New users can use a referral link or enter a referral code as a part of onboarding as a one-time bonus. In order to be eligible, the new user must:

1. Use a referral link or e~~E~~nter a referral code prior to connecting their first car;
2. Must be minting that specific car for the first time; and
3. Must fully connect their vehicle and qualify for one week of baseline rewards (see [DIP-2: Baseline Issuance](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/improvement-proposals/dip2)).

**Payout**

A one-time referral bonus of 50 $DIMO is paid out to at approximately 5:00 UTC the following Monday to both parties when a referred user meets all eligibility requirements (as specified in [Being referred](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/amendments/dip7a1#being-referred)) and while token supplies last (as specified in [#establishing-a-usddimo-pool-for-referral-bonuses](https://docs.dimo.zone/governance/amendments/dip7a1#establishing-a-usddimo-pool-for-referral-bonuses)).

**Adjustments**

The DIMO Foundation may adjust the referral amount, criteria for earning a referral, and which apps in addition to DIMO Mobile may participate in the referral program. Also, it may delay the payout to investigate suspicious activity if there are signs of a malicious or dishonest attack. The DIMO Foundation may withhold referral bonuses from a user indefinitely at its discretion if has good reason to believe the bonus was not earned in good faith.

## Implementation

If passed, this proposal will only be enacted when a licensed DIMO client adds functionality, compliant with this specification, to enable referrals. Digital Infrastructure Inc. is currently developing new functionality into the DIMO Mobile app allowing users to generate and input referral codes. Successful referrals would be tracked and shared with the DIMO Foundation, who will conduct the weekly issuance.
