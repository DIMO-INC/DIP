## Abstract

This DIP proposes the creation of a growth & marketing ecosystem team called ‘Velocity’. Notably, it acknowledges the team’s role in onboarding new users to the DIMO protocol and growing engagement. It explains the structure of the team, how it will operate, its explicit goals, and its responsibilities to the community.&#x20;

This DIP proposes an initial allocation of $700,000 in stable tokens and up to 40,000,000 $DIMO split into tranches contingent on hitting specific milestones.

## Motivation

A focused, funded team will increase the velocity of onboarding new users onto the DIMO network, drive brand awareness, grow and educate the community, help establish a presence in new markets, and more. As this team broadens DIMO’s reach more cars will connect and more developers will build on DIMO, accelerating the flywheel. &#x20;

## Specification

### Team Name

Velocity

### Purpose & Mission

#### **Mandates of the Velocity team:**

1. **Incentivize user adoption:** Create initiatives that educate and encourage new users to join the DIMO protocol, and try its services. This can drive sustained user adoption and increase overall engagement with the project.
2. **Increase brand awareness:** Work to raise awareness of the DIMO protocol, ensuring that the brand is consistently and effectively communicated across different platforms in a trusted manner. This includes facilitating education and high-quality conversation amongst our community. &#x20;
3. **Develop and manage partnerships:** Establish and maintain strategic partnerships with influencers, affiliates, and other relevant organizations to help expand DIMO’s reach, amplify its messaging, and build its credibility.
4. **Expand DIMO’s footprint into new regional markets:** Expansion presents several unique challenges ranging from prioritization, marketing, localization, demand for specific services, legal compliance, etc, that we will seek to push forward.

### Execution Plan & Team Operating Structure

The Velocity team will achieve its purpose through a combination of initiatives, ranging from blog posts, tweets, podcasts, incentive programs, media appearances, event sponsorships, quest programs, community moderation and more.&#x20;

This team will be run by the growth & marketing team at Digital Infrastructure Inc and associated contractors.

This team is uniquely qualified given their proven track record of growing the DIMO protocol to date (over 12,500 cars connected), their extensive growth/marketing experience, and domain knowledge across connected vehicles and web3. This team has also proven to act in good faith of the DIMO community.&#x20;

### Operating Goals & Metrics

This proposal acknowledges the responsibility that comes with funding and the use of the DIMO brand. The team intends to rigorously evaluate initiatives that drive core metrics and build trust with the community.

Some key initiatives include additional user token incentive programs; affiliate and brand partnerships; content and thought leadership; paid advertising and SEO; and funding DIMO quests on platforms such as Coinbase Learning, Layer3, or others.

**While subject to change, we will focus on managing specific metrics that tie directly to our mandate:**

### Financial Plan & Ask

#### **Budget**

**Funding Initiatives:** This proposal sets aside a pool of up to 40,000,000 $DIMO and 700,000 in stable tokens for Velocity. For the avoidance of doubt, this pool of funds is not to be used for payment to Digital Infrastructure Inc. or its affiliate's initiatives with the exception of the team’s compensation specified below.

These tokens would come from the[ unallocated treasury pool](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/token-details-and-distribution) of $DIMO. After all tranches have been unlocked and all funds have been allocated, the team may file another proposal at a later date to continue operating. In order to acquire the stable tokens to fund this proposal, the DIMO Foundation will sell $DIMO from the treasury at market prices using an over-the-counter service.

**Compensating the team:** For 12 months, or until amended by a governance vote, Digital Infrastructure Inc. will receive $10,000 as a flat monthly fee for providing this service ($120,000 total).

Funding for ecosystem marketing initiatives will be unlocked in tranches as described below.

| Tranche 1 | Amount                             | Unlock Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tranche 1 | <p>5M $DIMO</p><p>350k Stables</p> | Unlocked once DIP-9 Passes.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Tranche 2 | <p>5M $DIMO</p><p>350k Stables</p> | Unlocked once 50,000 vehicles IDs minted on-chain.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Tranche 3 | 30M $DIMO                          | To be unlocked if and when Coinbase Learn launches. Coinbase Learn allows the roughly 100,000,000 Coinbase users to earn $DIMO by completing informative quizzes and quests (e.g., mint your car, share your car, use an app). |

### Authority & Domain

#### **Utilize intellectual property and represent the brand**

The operating team may utilize the DIMO IP, such as trademarks and web domains, owned by the DIMO Foundation. It may also engage with partners/affiliates on DIMO’s behalf.&#x20;

Specifically, this team will have exclusive control over:

* The official DIMO [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dimo\_network), Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtube
* The official [DIMO Blog Platform](https://dimo.zone/news)
* The ability to create new official content channels

This team is not asking for the authority to limit the ability of community members to form unofficial groups and channels, write about DIMO, speak on podcasts, form communities, organize meetups, etc.&#x20;

### Commitments to DIMO

The Velocity team is committed to:

* Act honorably and in the best interest of the protocol
* Avoid conflicts of interest
* Assist other teams in promoting their various activities through official channels
* Strive to maximize transparency by providing monthly community updates including:
  * Recent incentive program performance and upcoming roadmap (if applicable)
  * $DIMO and stable tokens spent and amount left in the pool
  * Reporting on true north metrics
  * Reporting on overall activity taken across DIMO social channels and changes in community engagement as well as upcoming monthly targets.
    * Twitter: (Followers, tweets, impressions)
    * Discord: (Members)
    * Blog posts (published, views)

### Key Risks

There is an element of uncertainty regarding the impact of various initiatives on customer acquisition and brand perception. However, this risk is a necessary one, as it enables the brand to establish its presence, reach its target audience, and achieve long-term success. Funding growth initiatives is common amongst other reputable and successful blockchain communities.&#x20;

## Implementation

If passed, the team will immediately begin working towards its mandates. The initial token allocation of 5,000,000 $DIMO & $350,000 in stables will be allocated via the DIMO Foundation.
