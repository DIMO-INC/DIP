## Abstract

This is a slightly longer 3-5 sentence summary of the proposal.

## Motivation

This explains the rationale and goals for the DIP.

## Specification

The highly detailed description of the DIP including precise terms, protocol updates, blockchain transactions and smart contract code that will be executed with comments, and more.

The following components of the specification do not necessarily need to be in this exact order of format, but all should be covered.

### Team Name

Bonus points if you avoid putting DIMO in the name or using an acronym.

### Purpose & Mission

Describe in detail the team's reason for being. Be as specific as you can without being arbitrarily restricting. Note: As a rule of thumb, all work that exists within this team should be aligned directly with the purpose.&#x20;

Describe in detail your mission (how will you go about working towards your purpose). What is and isn’t in scope? What do you do and in which spaces do you operate? What don’t you do or where don’t you operate?

### Execution Plan

What have you executed on already? How will you achieve your goals and hit your financial plan? How will the team pull this off? What experience makes the team qualified? How will you structure and systematize accountability, organize tasks, leverage your connections, and achieve success?

### Operating Goals & Metrics

What are your operating goals and why? These should focus on building and developing the capabilities to achieve the purpose defined above. How will you know you are achieving them (what are the key performance indicators and why are these the right metrics)?

It is suggested to add charts, tables, and/or link to an external google sheets file with more information.

### Financial Plan & Ask

What are your historical financial results (if available) What are your financial projections for operating activities (revenue and detailed operating expense), investing activities, and financing activities? Be prepared to explain your business models and value creators. Do you plan for your team to reallocate funds to other teams or 3rd parties? Will those be grants, service contracts, investments, or something else? What is your financial ask? How much do you need allocated, when, and what do you propose is fair for unlock criteria?

It is suggested to add charts, tables, and/or link to an external google sheets file with more information.

### Team Operating Structure & Members

What roles exist on this team and who fills them? How does this team make decisions on things like: onboarding; offboarding; work allocation and responsibility delegation; tactical operating decisions; financial decisions; and changes to this internal operating structure.

There's no need to overthink this section if you are organized traditionally. It may read something like "Alice is the CEO and is the ultimate decision maker. Bob and Charlie are engineers who report to Alice."

### Authority & Domain

Do you need any exclusive authorities or domains granted to your team (that would give you some degree of control over individuals or teams, outside of your team) in order fulfill your plan? Examples: _Growth & Marketing_ needs exclusive domain over the official DIMO Medium and Twitter accounts; _Core Platform_ needs to be able to merge pull requests in Github; _Hardware Ecosystem_ needs the authority to issue licenses to device manufacturers.

### Commitments to DIMO

What is your team committing to in terms of performance, reporting, policy adherence, etc. on a temporary and ongoing basis? Examples: _Growth & Marketing_ reporting on impressions and committing to publishing 20 blog posts per quarter; _Core Platform_ committing to open source; _Hardware Ecosystem_ reporting on the performance statistics of licensed hardware providers.

### Key Risks

What are the key risks associated with your plan? What is at stake in terms of: market position; brand; legal; financial; and community / culture.
