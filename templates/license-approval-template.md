## Abstract

This is a slightly longer 3-5 sentence summary of the proposal.

## Motivation

This explains the rationale and goals for the DIP.

## Specification

The highly detailed description of the DIP including precise terms, protocol updates, blockchain transactions and smart contract code that will be executed with comments, and more.

The following components of the specification do not necessarily need to be in this exact order of format, but all should be covered.

### Corporate Details

At minimum, please include legal name, DBA, website, address, entity type (non-profit, C Corp, LLC), major owners, and contact details.

### Revenue Share

Describe the revenue share between the applicant and DIMO Network if applicable. For example, if applying to be a Node that sells user data, what percentage of revenue will the applicant keep and what percentage will go to the user?

### Technical Specifications

This should be the longest section. Please describe the technological specifications of the product or service. This is particularly important for hardware manufacturers, and should include device specifications and certifications.

### Safety Protocols

How would the applicant ensure the safety of the DIMO User and their data? How is data securely stored and encrypted? What is being tracked and who has access?&#x20;

### Commitments to DIMO

Is the applicant making any commitments to the DIMO network? A commitment to a certain service levels, production quantities, pricing, or anything else relevant.

## Implementation
