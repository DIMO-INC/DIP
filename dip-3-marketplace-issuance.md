## Abstract

In addition to [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md), users will receive Marketplace Issuance where they earn $DIMO based on fees paid by licensed DIMO applications.

Marketplace Issuance will start off very simple, but will likely evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves.

The DIMO Foundation will collect proceeds from the sale of aggregate and anonymized data and will distribute 1 $DIMO per $1 USD received evenly to the set of users who have opted in as a part of the vehicle pairing process.

Users may earn additional $DIMO when they use marketplace apps â€” the amount and terms will vary by app.
