## Abstract

This proposal specifies the conditions by which DIMO users will earn baseline $DIMO token rewards for connecting to the network.&#x20;

Baseline Issuance rewards users with a piece of a weekly issuance pool of $DIMO tokens. Users earn varying amounts based on how they're connected and how long they've been connected, even if there is no end customer using their data.

This stands in contrast to Marketplace Issuance, which rewards users based on fees generated by the network based on demand for user data.

To become eligible, users must download an authorized DIMO client, add their vehicle and establish an integration, complete vehicle minting and device pairing on-chain as applicable, and remain connected. As of the time of this writing, [DIMO Mobile](http://onelink.to/dimo) is the only authorized client.

450,000,000 $DIMO tokens (45% of total supply) are allocated to driver rewards. Deducting the airdrop, this leaves 382,491,185 $DIMO (38% of the total supply) to be issued over 40 years for Baseline Issuance.

## Motivation

The goal of Baseline Issuance is to prime the network by incentivizing drivers to connect the types of cars and stream the types of data that we expect will be valuable to data consumers and app developers in the future.
